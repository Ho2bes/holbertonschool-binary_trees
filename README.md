# Holberton School - Binary Trees

Welcome to the **Binary Trees** project! In this project, you will explore various types of binary trees and their associated algorithms. Binary trees are fundamental data structures in computer science, and they are widely used in many algorithms, such as search, sort, and navigation systems.

## ðŸ“š Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Define and explain the structure of **binary trees**, **binary search trees**, **AVL trees**, and **heaps**.
- Understand the properties and applications of **balanced** vs **unbalanced** trees.
- Implement basic operations such as **insertion**, **deletion**, and **search** in binary trees.
- Traverse a binary tree using **pre-order**, **in-order**, and **post-order** traversal techniques.
- Implement self-balancing trees like **AVL trees**.
- Analyze the **time complexity** and **space complexity** of binary tree operations.
